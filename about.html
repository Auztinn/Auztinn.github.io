    <p><h2></h2>Understanding who I am & how I got here:</h2></p>
        <br></br>
    <p>If you are looking for a driven, motivated & hardworking individual to improve your business, there is a good chance we work well together.
        Over the past year I have diligiently grown & developed my skills. What causes me to push myself to new limits? The first cause is 
      my family. They mean the world to me & I do whatever I can to support them. The second is those who have accomplished their goals &
      enocourage others to push hard. These two things are the driving force of why I am dedicated & work hard.
        <br></br>
        Currently, I am focusing on Front End Development while activley learning new skills & pushing my limits. More specifically, 
        HTML5, CSS & JavaScript are my main focus. As long as there is information to aquire about developement, I will never stop learning.
        <br></br>
      When working alongside me, you will find that I am a deeply dedicated person. Over the years, I have realized the value of 
      integrity & place it at the forefront of my career. With that said, I also enjoy laughing, reading & get to know my co-workers.</p>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
      </p> 
        <p>If you've made it this far, I want to deeply express my thanks. I have poured my heart into developing this website & I greatly
          appreciate you taking the time look at what I have created. I am alway open to constructive criticism so please email me with your
